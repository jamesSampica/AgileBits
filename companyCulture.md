# Is Your Company’s Culture Compatible with Scrum Values?

Not  every  company  is  ready  to  give  up  command-and-control  project  management and start self-organizing, and not every team is ready for collective commitment. The way to figure out if your team and company are ready is to evaluate whether the culture is compatible with the Scrum values. But how do the Scrum values translate into real-life practice? 

Ask yourself each of these questions, and try to come up with honest answers. Discuss them with your team, and with your manager. If everyone is really OK with each of these things, then your company and team are ready for the Scrum values. If not, then those conversations will help you figure the right approach to bringing Scrum to your team. 

To understand if you're ready for commitment, ask if you, your team, and your boss are OK with:

* Relinquishing control of the project, and trusting the team to decide what gets delivered?
* Not going off on your own and building something without talking to the rest of the team, and just integrating it at the end?
* Not having one "single, wringable neck?"
* Listening  to  comments  and  feedback, and not telling people to mind their own business?
* Actually being willing to take responsibility? Does everyone on the team feel the same way?

To  understand  if you're ready for respect, ask if you, your team, and your boss are OK with:

* Trusting the team to do the right thing, and deliver each feature at the best possible date based on relative value and how the project progresses—even if it causes the project to take longer than you expect?
* Giving the team enough time to do the work, and not demanding overtime of them?
* Trusting the team to choose the tasks that are right for them and for the project, rather than relying on strict roles, RACI matrices, etc.?
* Not being able to ever say again that you don’t know why the team decided to do something the way they did?

To understand if you’re ready for focus, ask if you, your team, and your boss are OK with:

* Never asking anyone on the team to do work that's not part of the current sprint?
* Never asking anyone on your team to do work that the whole team hasn't agreed to take on ("but I need this done now!")?
* Putting  what's  most  valuable to the company ahead of all other project or work concerns?
* Not being able to demand that team members work on specific tasks in a certain order up front?

To understand if you’re ready for openness, ask if you, your team, and your boss are OK with:

* Listening to what other people have to say—and actually thinking about it?
* Thinking about project planning or users if you never have before?
* Thinking about technical details if you never have before?
* Thinking about what the programmer next to you is working on, and whether it really fits into the overall goal?
* The programmer next to you thinking about your work in exactly the same way?

To  understand  if  you’re  ready  for  courage, ask if you, your team, and your boss are OK with:

* Not being able to blame lack of planning on your project manager?
* Not being able to blame poor requirements that don’t hit the mark on your Product Owner or senior managers?
* Taking the time to really understand your users?
* Building something that isn't perfect, because what the users need most is some‐thing that's simply good enough?

If the answer to most of those questions is "yes," then your team, managers, and company probably have a culture that matches the Scrum values. On the other hand, if you’ve answered “no” to more than one or two bullets for any of the values, then that's a good starting point for a realistic and open discussion with your team and your boss. And if that open discussion sounds unrealistic, then you’re definitely going to have to work on openness if you want to get the most out of Scrum
